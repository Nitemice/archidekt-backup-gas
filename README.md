# Archidekt Backup Script

*Export deck lists from Archidekt, as text and/or JSON, using Google Apps Script.*

This script can be used to automatically bulk-export a user's collection of
public deck lists, or all public desk lists within a public folder, as both
text and JSON. They are stored in a specified Google Drive directory, where
they can be easily downloaded or shared.

**NOTE**: All deck lists and folders being exported must be set to public.
          This option can be found under the "Settings" for each deck, or in
          the "â«¶" menu in the folder view.

## Usage

This script is designed to be run on-demand via the GAS interface, or
periodically via GAS triggers. For more info on setting up GAS triggers, see
[this Google Apps Script guide](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/triggers).

To execute the script, simply run the `main()` function.

## Setup

There are two basic steps necessary to run this script.

1. [Customize your config file](#1.-Customize-your-config-file)
2. [Load the script into a new Google Apps Script project](#2.-Load-the-script-into-a-new-Google-Apps-Script-project)

### 1. Customize your config file

`config.js` should contain a single JavaScript object, used to specify all
necessary configuration information. Here's where you specify the user, the
desired format(s), as well as the Google Drive directory to save exported
files to.

An example version is provided, named `example.config.js`, which can be
renamed or copied to `config.js` before loading into the GAS project.

The basic structure can be seen below.

```js
const config = {
    "userId": "<Archidekt user ID>",
    "deckFolders": ["<Archidekt folder ID>", ...],
    "onlyBackupFolders": <true/false>,
    "outputFormat":  ["json", "archidekt", "basic"],
    "backupDir": "<Google Drive directory ID>",
    "removeMissingDecklists": <true/false>
};
```

- `userId`: User ID of the Archidekt user whose deck lists are being exported.
    This can be found by navigating to the user's profile page, and grabbing
    the ID from the tail of the URL.
- `deckFolders`: An array of folder IDs of Archidekt folders that are to be exported.
    This can be found by navigating to each folder page, and grabbing the ID
    from the tail of the URL.
    This option can be omitted if you only want to export the deck lists of a
    single user, and do not want to maintain the folder structure.
- `onlyBackupFolders`: This option will only back up deck lists found in the
    folders and subfolders indicated by the `deckFolders` list. Otherwise, all
    public deck lists owned by the specified user will be backed up.
- `outputFormat`: An array indicating the desired output format(s).
    Valid values are:
    * `basic` - A text file that only includes the mainboard and sideboard,
        which can be imported into MTGO.
    * `archidekt` - A text file, in the format of Archidekt's Deck Edit view,
        preserving all categories & edition information.
    * `json` - A JSON file that includes the deck list, along with other
        details of the deck, such as description.
    * `rawJson` - Raw, (mostly) unedited JSON file, direct from the API.
        This is useful if you want to capture every detail of the cards and deck
        that are not preserved by the other formats.

- `backupDir`: The ID of the Google Drive directory, where exported data
    should be stored. This can be found by navigating to the folder, and
    grabbing the ID from the tail of the URL.
- `removeMissingDecklists`: This option will remove backed up deck list files
    if do not match a current decklist, e.g. name changed, moved folders, or
    deleted.

### 2. Load the script into a new Google Apps Script project

You can manually load the script into a
[new GAS project](https://www.google.com/script/start/),
by simply copying and pasting it into the editor.

Or you can use a
[tool like clasp](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp)
to upload it directly. For more information on using clasp, here is a
[guide I found useful](https://github.com/gscharf94/Clasp-Basics-for-Reddit).
